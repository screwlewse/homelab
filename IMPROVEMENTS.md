- ✅ Implemented trap handlers for better error reporting
- ✅ Added color output detection for terminal compatibility

### 2. **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation**

  - `ci.yml` - Continuous Integration with linting and security checks
  - `cd.yml` - Continuous Deployment with Terraform automation
  - `test.yml` - Automated testing pipeline
  - `manual-ops.yml` - Manual operations for maintenance tasks

### 3. **Pre-commit Hooks**
- ✅ Configured pre-commit framework with multiple hooks:
  - ShellCheck for shell script linting
  - Terraform fmt and validation
  - YAML linting with yamllint
  - Markdown linting
  - Security scanning with tfsec and detect-secrets
  - Git commit message linting with gitlint

### 4. **Terraform Improvements**
- ✅ Added variable validation for all inputs
- ✅ Created environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, prod)
- ✅ Improved module structure with consistent patterns
- ✅ Added proper output descriptions

### 5. **Comprehensive Testing Framework**
- ✅ BATS tests for shell scripts
- ✅ Terraform unit tests with Terratest
- ✅ Python integration tests for Kubernetes components
- ✅ Security compliance tests
- ✅ Infrastructure validation tests
- ✅ Automated test runner with reporting

### 6. **Security Enhancements**
- ✅ Removed hardcoded passwords from scripts
- ✅ Added secrets scanning in CI pipeline
- ✅ Implemented security checks with tfsec
- ✅ Added git-secrets integration
- ✅ Created security compliance tests

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Run All Tests
```bash
make test
```

### Run Specific Test Types
```bash
make test-bats        # Shell script tests
make test-unit        # Terraform unit tests
make test-integration # Integration tests
make test-security    # Security tests
make test-quick       # Quick validation
```

### Setup Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
make pre-commit
```

### Run Linters
```bash
make lint
```

## 🚀 CI/CD Usage

### Automatic Triggers
- Push to main branch triggers CI pipeline
- Pull requests trigger CI and test pipelines
- Tags trigger deployment pipeline

### Manual Deployment
```yaml
# Trigger deployment via GitHub Actions UI
workflow: CD Pipeline
inputs:
  environment: dev/staging/prod
  terraform_action: plan/apply/destroy
```

### Manual Operations
```yaml
# Trigger manual operations
workflow: Manual Operations
inputs:
  operation: backup-state/validate-infrastructure/etc.
```

## 📋 Pre-commit Usage

### Initial Setup
```bash
./scripts/setup-pre-commit.sh
```

### Manual Run
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Skip Hooks (Emergency)
```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Secrets Management**
   - Use environment-specific tfvars files
   - Never commit actual passwords
   - Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD

2. **Security Scanning**
   - tfsec runs on every commit
   - detect-secrets prevents credential leaks
   - Security compliance tests in CI

3. **Best Practices**
   - All scripts use strict error handling
   - Proper input validation
   - Secure defaults for development

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Production Hardening**
   - Implement proper secrets management (Vault, Sealed Secrets)
   - Enable TLS for all services
   - Add network policies

2. **Monitoring Enhancement**
   - Add custom Grafana dashboards
   - Configure alert rules
   - Implement log aggregation with Loki

3. **Advanced Testing**
   - Add performance tests
   - Implement chaos engineering tests
   - Add compliance scanning (CIS benchmarks)

## 🎉 Benefits

- **Improved Reliability**: Proper error handling prevents silent failures
- **Better Security**: Automated scanning catches vulnerabilities early
- **Faster Development**: Pre-commit hooks catch issues before commit
- **Consistent Quality**: Automated linting ensures code standards
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Multiple test layers ensure stability
- **Easy Maintenance**: Well-documented and automated processes

These improvements transform the k8s-devops-pipeline into a production-ready, enterprise-grade infrastructure automation solution while maintaining its simplicity for homelab use.
